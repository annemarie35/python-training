# 1. Getting started

> A computer does two things, and two things only: it performs calculations and it remembers the results of those calculations. But it does those two things very well.

Computational thinking 
Knowledge can be thought as either **declarative**(statement of facts) or **imperative** (how to knowledge or recipes)
Algorithm : a sequence of simple steps with a flow of control that specifies when to execute each steps. 

Early computers were fixed-program computers, exemple in 1941 Atanasoff and Berry or Turing's machine

> Each programming language has a set of primitive constructs, a syntax, a static semantics, and a semantics. By analogy with a natural language, e.g., English, the primitive constructs are words, the syntax describes which strings of words constitute well-formed sentences, the static semantics defines which sentences are meaningful, and the semantics defines the meaning of those sentences. The primitive constructs in Python include literals (e.g., the number 3.2 and the string ‘abc’) and infix operators (e.g., + and /).
